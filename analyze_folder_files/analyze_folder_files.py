analyze_folder_files.py

This script recursively processes all files in a given folder.
For each file, it reads the contents and sends them along with a system prompt
to the Gemini LLM (model "gemini-exp-1206") for analysis (grammar checking and XML/Markdown validation).
The responses are aggregated into a single timestamped output file with clear separators.
Note: The script excludes the ".git" folder and any ".gitignore" file from processing.
